# Personal Information

Alexander Yeo<br/>
Student number s3795259<br/>
Email Address: s3795259@student.rmit.edu.au

My name is Alex and I was born and raised in Australia. Upon completing school I’ve tried my hand at a number of things, most notably completing a Certificate III in Baking and pursing a career in Aquaculture. I’m also an avid home recording enthusiast, multi-instrumentalist and dog lover! 



# Interest in IT

**What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).**

I have always been fascinated with technology, and I always find myself amazed seeing or reading about the latest cutting edge developments in various areas of IT. I really began to delve deeper in the world of IT when I decided I wanted to set up a home recording studio . The more I learned about the various tools used in audio production (digital audio workstations, digital amplifier modelling etc.), the more I became fascinated by the wonders of IT. It has also recently became a goal of mine to learn how to build websites or develop app’s and software. 

**Why did you choose to come to RMIT?**

 I chose to study at RMIT because of its’ reputation as an excellent place to learn about IT. The option of studying online that RMIT provides, really impacted on my decision to come here also. The flexibility of learning online through RMIT means I can work to support myself more easily and also choose my own hours of study. 

**What do you expect to learn during your studies?**

I hope to gain a fundamental understanding what Information Technology is. I want learn about all the various sectors of the industry, the history of the industry and where it’s likely to be heading in the future. I’m also interested to learn about some of the challenges, problems and ethical implications surrounding the use of IT in certain applications. Ultimately, I’d like to find out what areas of IT I’m drawn to, and learn how to make a contribution to that area.
